# Web design

## Design
This design features an interactive card design.  
The most important aspect is the 3D depth of the cards.  
I've created a moving background of rectangles which should increase depth of the cards.  
On first load, the zero state, the user will see an animation of the card to give awareness of it's interactiveness.  
If the user hovers over a card he will see it moving in depth, this effect should give the user a clue that there is more content behind or within the card.  
When scrolling the cards will change in depth for the same effect named above.  
When interacting with the primary action, the card will flip or fold and reveal it's contents.  

## Principles of User Interface Design:


2. Interfaces exist to enable interaction
6. One primary action per screen
7. Keep secondary action secondary
8. Provide a natural next step
11. Strong visual hierarchies work best
12. Smart organization reduces cognitive load
14. Progressive disclosure
Show only what is necessary on each screen. If people are making a choice, show enough information to allow them the choice, then dive into details on a subsequent screen*. Avoid the tendency to over-explain or show everything all at once. When possible, defer decisions to subsequent screens by progressively disclosing information as necessary. This will keep your interactions more clear.


*subsequent screens = de volgende state

- Fix typografie, placement
- BlauwGroen op wit contrast is nog niet voldoende
- Mooie scrollbar
- Wat is de website!?!?!?
